# Claude setup

Claude Code gets the same source skills and release checks as Codex. Its install and use tests run on their own schedule.

A **Code plugin** is a package installed for Claude Code. An **account upload** is a skill added through Customize in Claude. Check both stores. A successful Code update does not prove that Chat has the same files.

See the [September account repair check](../claude-account-repair-2026-09-08.md) for dated results and remaining app checks.

Read the [current candidate record](../client-candidate-v0.13.0.md) before enabling an update. It records the 0.13.0 packages and the still-active Code engineering hold. The 0.12.0 account replacements and the older checks below keep their original dates and versions.

## Check what is there

```sh
claude --version
claude plugin list --json
```

Check personal skills, project skills, and plugins for copies with the same name. Keep a list of old copies before changing anything. In the app, also check **Customize > Skills > Yours**. A personal upload and a plugin can both appear there.

## Install one reviewed pack

Replace the example path with your local checkout. These commands change your install:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/skills --scope user
claude plugin install jovanipink-skills@jovanipink-skills --scope user
claude plugin list --json
```

The install argument is `plugin@marketplace`. The marketplace here is named `jovanipink-skills`, and one of its seven packs carries that same name, so `jovanipink-skills@jovanipink-skills` is correct rather than a typo. Every other pack reads as `jovanipink-engineering@jovanipink-skills` and follows the same shape.

For an existing install, refresh the marketplace before updating the plugin. Use `claude plugin marketplace update --help` and `claude plugin update --help` to check the current command form. Save the old version and file hashes first. Check every installed file after the update. In the observed 2.1.220 update, all seven packs moved to 0.11.0 and their files matched the generated source. The desktop plugin pages also showed the new version; that did not establish behavior in an existing task.

Start a fresh task, then select the full plugin command:

```text
/jovanipink-skills:claim-verification Check which completion claims have evidence. Make no changes.
```

Generated Claude packages omit Codex's `agents/` files. Skills that require direct selection get `disable-model-invocation: true`. Check both direct selection and a related prompt that should leave the skill inactive.

## Check each app mode

Claude desktop Code mode, Claude.ai, and Cowork each need their own record. Note whether the task runs locally or remotely. Check loading, linked files, result files, and resume behavior in each mode you use.

For an account upload, build the separate one-skill ZIP with `python3 scripts/package_claude_ai.py`. Review it before uploading. The command prepares all 78 skills; it does not approve every ZIP for every app. Keep a separate upload checklist. The current staged target is 64 skills that allow automatic selection, with 14 explicit-only workflows held. Do not upload an explicit-only skill until the receiving mode has a verified control that prevents automatic selection. A metadata field or working slash command alone does not prove that control.

To update an existing account skill:

1. Open the skill's detail page. Use its menu to download the old copy. Check that the file opens.
2. Choose **Replace** from that same menu. The replacement page has a **browse** button for the reviewed ZIP.
3. Choose **Save**. The app runs its scan during the save. Stop if it shows a failure or warning.
4. Refresh the detail page. Wait for **Contents** to load, then check the version, file count, and linked files. The first view can show cached text.
5. Download the saved entry. Compare every file inside it with the approved package.
6. On failure, stop that batch. Use **Replace** with the saved old file, or turn off **Enable skill**. Check the restored version or disabled state before continuing.

Do not retry a save just because navigation stopped. Inspect the entry first. In the September 9 check, one save left the old version unchanged; a later retry worked. Other page transitions completed the save before a navigation error. Those entries did not need another replacement.

In the earlier 0.11 web check, claim-verification changed from one file to two files. A fresh Chat task visibly read both files. This does not prove current Cowork or desktop task behavior.

Check that each download exists and opens before replacing or disabling its entry. Older uploads may download as `.skill` archives; newer entries may download as one-skill plugin ZIPs. Compare the skill files inside them. Neither the archive name nor a mount path alone proves the install source. Use Replace rather than creating another entry with the same name.

Refresh the web and desktop libraries after an account change. Check both lists before uploading another copy. Use fresh tasks to check the files actually loaded; an old task can retain old instructions. Save file hashes and tool output, then test linked files, result downloads, failed checks, unfinished work, and resumption. Record **prepared**, **installed**, **enabled**, **loaded**, and **behavior-tested** separately.

Personal preferences belong in the user's `CLAUDE.md` for local Code use. Repository guidance uses the checked-in `CLAUDE.md`. Confirm which files loaded; do not assume a local file syncs to a cloud task.

If a live check reports expired sign-in, leave it blocked until sign-in is refreshed. Read the process exit code and error text as well as its final event. In one observed authentication failure, the CLI emitted a `success` subtype with `is_error: true` while exiting with code 1. That is not a passing check.

Follow the [shared client checks](../client-support.md). Remove duplicate copies only after reviewing their source and saving what is needed to restore them.
