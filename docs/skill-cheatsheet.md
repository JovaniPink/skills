# JovaniPink Skills Cheatsheet

Use this page to find a skill quickly. The catalog contains 79 skills across seven plugins. For installation and client details, read [How to Use JovaniPink Skills](README.md). For fuller explanations, read the [Skill Catalog Reader Guide](skill-catalog-reader-guide.md).

## Invocation legend

- `Implicit`: The client may select the skill when the request clearly matches its description. You can still select it directly when the client supports direct selection.
- `Explicit-only`: The skill must be selected directly. Selecting it does not authorize push, merge, deletion, publication, deployment, credential use, or another protected action.

Common direct-selection forms:

| Client | Form |
| --- | --- |
| ChatGPT | Type `@`, then select the installed skill. |
| Codex | Use `$plugin-name:skill-name`. |
| Claude Code | Use `/plugin-name:skill-name`. |
| Claude.ai | Use a matching request. Direct explicit-only behavior is not claimed for this surface. |

## Safety reminder

A skill guides workflow and judgment. It does not replace repository protections, host permissions, tests, access controls, or human approval. Keep local, committed, pushed, reviewed, merged, deployed, and live states separate.
