# Authority Boundary Review

Make authority claims explicit and verify them against operational behavior rather than diagrams alone.

## Workflow

1. Inventory relevant stores, queues, files, APIs, caches, and projections.
2. For each artifact, identify:
   - what fact or bytes it owns
   - who may write it
   - who reads it and for what decision
   - whether it is authoritative, derived, cached, archival, or proposed
3. Trace create, update, delete, retry, replay, backfill, and reconciliation paths.
4. Locate the ratified contract: code, schema, policy, ADR, configuration, or live provider state. Label unratified documents as proposals.
5. Test disagreement scenarios. State which source wins, how conflicts surface, and whether repair is automatic, manual, or absent.
6. Identify ambiguous dual writers, irreversible projections, missing version checks, or reads that bypass the declared authority.
7. Separate documentation corrections from physical migrations, writer changes, backfills, or deployments.

## Output

Provide an authority matrix with `Artifact`, `Owned fact`, `Class`, `Writer`, `Readers`, `Conflict rule`, and `Evidence`. Follow it with confirmed boundaries, contradictions, proposed changes, and unresolved decisions.

Do not call a migration complete from schema or code changes alone. Writer cutover, historical data, reconciliation, deployment, and live reads require separate evidence.
