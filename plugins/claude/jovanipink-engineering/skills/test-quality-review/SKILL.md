description: Review the quality of a test suite or change-specific tests for meaningful assertions, defect sensitivity, isolation, determinism, risk coverage, and maintenance cost. Use when existing gates pass but the strength of the tests themselves is uncertain.

# Test Quality Review

Use current primary guidance as a review baseline, then report only what the available evidence supports. Primary authority: [official reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

## Workflow

1. Identify the behaviors and risks the tests are expected to protect.
2. Trace representative tests from setup through action, oracle, cleanup, and failure output.
3. Check that assertions can fail for the target defect and are not coupled only to implementation details.
4. Review boundary, negative, concurrency, retry, migration, permission, and recovery coverage where relevant.
5. Inspect isolation, determinism, clocks, randomness, network, shared state, fixtures, and parallel safety.
6. Find skipped, quarantined, flaky, snapshot-heavy, redundant, slow, or low-signal coverage.
7. Recommend focused mutations or controlled defect injection to test sensitivity when authorized.

## Boundaries

- Do not equate test count, line coverage, or a green suite with meaningful behavioral protection.
- Do not weaken assertions or accept broad snapshots merely to reduce failures.
- Do not execute destructive fixtures or shared-environment tests without explicit authorization.

## Output

Return Protected behavior, Oracle quality, Missing risks, Flakiness and isolation, Maintenance cost, and Recommended evidence.
