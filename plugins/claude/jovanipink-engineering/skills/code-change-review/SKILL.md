# Code Change Review

Review a pinned change and return evidence-bounded findings.

## Workflow

1. Pin the repository, base revision, head revision, diff scope, intended behavior, and relevant authority.
2. Read the changed code in context, including callers, consumers, contracts, tests, configuration, and generated boundaries.
3. Test each suspected issue against actual control flow, data flow, upgrade order, failure handling, and repository conventions.
4. Rank only actionable findings by user impact and likelihood. Attach exact locations and a concrete failure scenario.
5. Check whether tests would fail for the defect and whether the proposed behavior is compatible with existing consumers.
6. Separate findings from questions, optional improvements, and unsupported concerns.
7. Report validation performed, unavailable evidence, and the remaining review boundary.

## Boundaries

- A changed line is not automatically defective, and an unchanged line can still be affected.
- Do not implement fixes unless the user separately asks for changes.
- Do not treat a review comment as a decision, a passing check as merge authority, or a mergeable state as approval.
- Do not claim the change is safe outside the inspected scope.

## Output

Lead with findings ordered by severity, most severe first. For each finding provide `Severity`, `State`, `Location`, `Failure`, `Evidence`, `Impact`, and `Suggested direction`. Grade `Severity` as `none`, `note`, `warning`, or `error`. Set `State` to `new`, `unchanged`, `updated`, or `absent` against the pinned base revision. Then report `Questions`, `Validation`, and `Review boundary`. If no actionable finding survives verification, say so and name remaining risks or untested surfaces.
