# Request Code Review

Give reviewers a precise packet that separates proposed code from checks, decisions, deployment, and merge authority.

## Workflow

1. Verify repository identity, base and head branches, exact revision, diff scope, and unrelated changes.
2. Summarize the problem, chosen approach, user-visible or contract impact, and excluded work.
3. Record checks by exact command and result. Name tests or environments that were not run.
4. Identify security, data, compatibility, migration, operational, and rollback risks.
5. Provide a short review focus with concrete questions and high-risk files or paths.
6. Confirm whether the user authorized only preparing the packet or also sending it through a named external channel.
7. After an authorized send, read back the created request, URL, revision, reviewer state, and checks.

## Boundaries

- Explicit invocation does not by itself authorize push, PR creation, reviewer assignment, external messaging, merge, or deployment.
- Do not describe a check as passing from stale output or a different revision.
- A review request is proposed work, not approval or merge authority.

## Output

Return `Scope`, `Approach`, `Evidence`, `Risks`, `Not tested`, `Review focus`, `Authority`, and, if sent, `External readback`.
