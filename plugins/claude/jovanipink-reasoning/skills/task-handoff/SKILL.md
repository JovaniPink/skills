# Task Handoff

Create a compact, verifiable continuation record without transferring hidden reasoning or unrelated private context.

## Workflow

1. Name the objective, repository or system boundary, intended recipient, and exact continuation point.
2. Verify current branch, revision, worktree state, remote or PR state, validation, and external surface state when each claim is relevant and accessible.
3. Separate completed work, partially completed work, proposed work, blocked work, and work not started.
4. Record decisions with their status and evidence. Preserve unresolved questions and named decision owners.
5. List changed files or artifacts, commands already run, observed results, known failures, and safe next checks.
6. State authorized actions, actions requiring new approval, sensitive context that is deliberately omitted, and stopping conditions.
7. Provide the smallest ordered next-step list that lets the recipient verify before acting.

## Boundaries

- Do not describe local work as pushed, a PR as merged, a preview as deployed, or a deployment as live without current evidence.
- Do not include chain-of-thought, raw transcripts, credentials, personal data, or unrelated repository details.
- A handoff transfers context, not authority.
- Write a file or send the handoff externally only when that destination and action are authorized.

## Output

Lead with `Continuation point` and `Next verification or action`, then return `Objective`, `Exact state`, `Completed`, `In progress`, `Decisions`, `Evidence`, `Changed artifacts`, `Validation`, `Blockers`, `Authority boundary`, and `Next verification steps`.

## Continuity and evidence

Lead with the continuation point and next verification or executable action. Retain the objective, exact revision and working state, changed artifacts, decisions, unresolved work, evidence references and freshness, existing authorization, and stop conditions. Use a compact record when sufficient and a fuller record when requested or needed. Reverify stale evidence before dependent action; do not repeat work already proved current.

Read [the original acceptance example](references/continuity-example.md) when checking this behavior.
