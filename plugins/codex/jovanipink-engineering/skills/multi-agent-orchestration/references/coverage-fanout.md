# Coverage Fanout

Use coverage fanout when one artifact must be inspected through independent, non-overlapping lenses.

1. Define the exact artifact and shared revision.
2. Assign distinct coverage dimensions, such as security, accessibility, compatibility, performance, or test quality.
3. Keep file ownership read-only unless each writer has an isolated target.
4. Require findings to include location, scenario, evidence, severity, and uncertainty.
5. Deduplicate overlapping findings and reconcile conflicting conclusions against the artifact.
6. Run integration validation after any accepted changes.

Fanout increases coverage, not authority. A worker report is a lead until the integration owner verifies it.
