# Python Engineering Profile

Use this profile only after repository discovery identifies the stack. Read [focused checks](references/checks.md) when stack-specific gates or hazards determine the result.

## Workflow

1. Discover `pyproject.toml`, lockfiles, package layout, environment files, tox or nox configuration, and repository scripts.
2. Follow repository-defined commands and pinned tool versions before suggesting defaults.
3. Review idiomatic design and material hazards, especially mutable defaults, import cycles, dynamic typing gaps, async cancellation, context-manager cleanup, serialization, timezone handling, and environment drift.
4. Select proportionate gates from repository scripts, formatting, linting, static typing, unit and integration tests, package builds, and dependency or vulnerability checks when configured.
5. Review compatibility across supported Python versions, packaging metadata, public imports, typing behavior, platform wheels, database drivers, and deprecations.
6. Report every missing tool, skipped command, unsupported platform, or unavailable environment as incomplete rather than passing.

## Boundaries

- Do not invent one universal command or replace repository policy with generic preferences.
- Do not install, upgrade, publish, deploy, apply, or mutate shared state merely to run a gate.
- Separate static review, executed checks, build evidence, provider state, and live behavior.

## Output

Return Discovery, Hazards, Commands selected, Results, Compatibility, Missing evidence, and Next safe gate.
