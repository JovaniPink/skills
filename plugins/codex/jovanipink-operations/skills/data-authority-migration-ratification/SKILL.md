description: Prepare a proposed data-authority and migration decision record covering owners, writers, readers, cutover, reconciliation, rollback, and acceptance. Use when decision owners need evidence to ratify or reject a migration contract; the skill cannot ratify it.

# Data Authority and Migration Ratification

Use generic terminology and preserve the status of every material statement: observed fact, proposal, ratified decision, rejected decision, unresolved question, measured result, estimate, or causal claim.

## Workflow

1. Map current authoritative stores, exact-byte custody, projections, writers, readers, and reconciliation paths.
2. Define proposed target authority, allowed writers, read paths, transformations, conflict rules, and data contracts.
3. Describe migration phases, compatibility, backfill, cutover, dual-operation limits, contraction, and cleanup.
4. Specify reconciliation invariants, thresholds, sampling, quarantine, retry, and evidence ownership.
5. Define rollback or roll-forward behavior for code, state, partially migrated data, and downstream consumers.
6. Name the decision owner, consulted owners, required evidence, go or no-go gates, and ratification record.
7. Keep status proposed until the named owner provides explicit ratification evidence.

## Boundaries

- Do not declare a new authority, writer, migration, cutover, or production state ratified without owner evidence.
- Do not execute migrations, enable writes, or change production systems.
- Do not expose private schemas, topology, identities, or customer data in public outputs.

## Output

Return Current authority, Proposed contract, Migration phases, Reconciliation, Rollback, Risks, Decision owner, Required evidence, and Status.
